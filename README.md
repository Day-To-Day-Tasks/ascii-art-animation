# ASCII Art Animation

This program generates an ASCII art animation of a 3D landscape using C programming language. The animation is displayed in the terminal window.

## Prerequisites

Before running the program, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

- C Compiler (e.g., `gcc`)
- `make` (optional, but recommended)

## Steps to Compile and Run

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Day-To-Day-Tasks/ascii-art-animation.git
cd ascii-art-animation
```

### Step 2: Navigate to the Source Code Directory

Navigate to the directory containing the C source code:

```bash
cd ascii-art-animation
```

### Step 3: Compile the Source Code

Compile the C source code using `gcc`:

```bash
gcc -o ascii_art ascii_art.c -lm
```

This command compiles the `ascii_art.c` file and generates an executable named `ascii_art`.

### Step 4: Run the Program

Run the compiled executable:

```bash
./ascii_art
```

This command executes the compiled program, and you should see the ASCII art animation displayed in your terminal window.

### Step 5: Exiting the Program

To exit the program, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal window where the animation is running.

## Additional Notes

- The animation may take a few moments to render, depending on your system's processing power.
- You can modify the parameters in the source code to customize the appearance of the ASCII art landscape.
